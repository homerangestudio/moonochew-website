question: "How many trees can one guard protect?"
answer: "Moonochew is infinitely reusable. Once a tree is established and has grown beyond livestock reach (typically 3-5 years depending on species), simply remove the guard and use it on your next planting. One guard can protect hundreds of trees over generations."
