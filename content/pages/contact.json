        "question": "How long does shipping take?",
        "answer": "We ship Australia-wide with delivery typically taking 5-7 business days. Guards are shipped pre-folded for easy handling. You'll receive tracking information once your order is dispatched. For urgent orders or bulk shipments, please contact us directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Moonochew work with all cattle breeds?",
        "answer": "Moonochew is designed for use with domestic poll cattle. Moonochew has been tested for over 12 years with various cattle breeds including Angus, Hereford and dairy breeds. The barbed stainless steel design consistently deters domestic cattle from rubbing or browsing on protected trees. Though we have used Moonochew successfully with horned cattle and bulls, it is unrealistic to offer a guarantee against bulls, wild, or horned cattle."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer bulk or wholesale pricing?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! We work with landcare groups, councils, large-scale regeneration projects, and farms needing multiple guards. We also offer rental and fee-for-service models given Moonochew's infinite reusability. Please use the contact form above or email us directly to discuss your requirements."
