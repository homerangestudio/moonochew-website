    "paragraphs": [
      "Andrew Humphreys didn't set out to revolutionize tree protection. He was simply trying to solve a problem every farmer knows too well: how do you protect young trees from cattle without creating more waste, more expense, and more headaches?",
      "For over a decade, Andrew experimented, failed, learned, and tried again. He tested different materials, different designs, different approaches. He studied how cattle interact with barriers, how trees grow in protected microclimates, and how traditional guards fail.",
      "The real innovation was understanding that a tree guard doesn't need to be discarded. With the right design and the right steel, one guard could protect tree after tree, decade after decade."

    "philosophy": "Moonochew isn't just a product. It's a philosophy: build things that last, design with nature in mind, and never settle for waste when permanence is possible."
